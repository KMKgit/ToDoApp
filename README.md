# To Do App

### Reasoning behind the technologies used
For this project I used the following technologies, all of which I have experience with:
- **Java Spring Boot**: I chose Spring Boot because I have worked with it before and I felt comfortable using it. It is a powerful framework that allows me to create a REST API quickly and easily.
- **Flyway**: I used Flyway to manage the database migrations. It allows me to keep track of the changes in the database schema.
- **PostgreSQL**: I chose PostgreSQL as the database because it is a powerful and reliable database that has good performance.
- **Docker**: I used Docker to containerize the application. It allows me to run the application in a container and deploy it quickly.
- **Quasar**: I chose Quasar, a framework with VueJS components, to create the frontend. It helped me to create a responsive and modern user interface.

### How to run the application
To run the application, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can run the following commands to start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
